## Exercise 1
Program for 'Employee' class which print the final salary of 20 days based on given Condition.
1. Takes the hourly salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter and calculate base salary for 20days.
2. adds $10 to the base salary of the employee if it is less than $500.  
3. adds $5 daily to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours. 

 <h3 align="left">Run Program:</h3>
Run Matches.java class - To print the required output. 

 ##### Classes Details
1Code logic for this exercise is in [Employee.java] class. Normal and parametrize test are performed on code logic. 
- Employee.java Location: "src\\main\\java\\Employee.java"

2 Test Cases for logic return in EmployeeTest.java and EmployeeTestParameterize.java 
- EmployeeTest Location:"src\\test\\java\\EmployeeTest"
- EmployeeTestParameterize Location:"src\\test\\java\\EmployeeTestParameterize"

##
## Exercise 2
Program to print the perimeter and the area of a square, a rectangle and a circle. 
1. Accept the user input for Length, breadth, height, radius
2. Print result like area and perimeter of shapes on screen. 

  <h3 align="left">Run Program:</h3>
Run Shapes.java class - To print the required output. 

 ##### Classes Details
1Code logic for this exercise is in [Shapes.java] class. Normal and parametrize test are performed on code logic.

##
## Exercise 3
Program to manage the ranking points of different teams. 

- FOOTBALL TEAM: Win: add 3 points; Drawn: add 1 point; Lose: do nothing. 
- BASKETBALL TEAM: Win: add 2 points; Lose: do nothing. 

1.	Load teams parameters from teams.csv file; for each line define the instance for a team; 
2.	Print standing of Football teams (ordering by points); 
3.	Print standing of Basketball teams (ordering by points); 
4.	Load results of the last matches from results.csv file and update teams points based on loaded results; 
5.	Print new standing of Football teams (ordering by points); 
6.	Print new standing of Basketball teams (ordering by points). 


  <h3 align="left">Run Program:</h3>
Run Matches.java class - To print the required output. 


 ##### Classes Details
- Teams -Interface
- Matches -Class
